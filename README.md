**Sea Monster Adventures** is a website for the company Sea Monster Crowdfunding that displays information about the games they have funded.

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

## Notes

The main challenges that I faced while building the app were switching from using the traditional coding methods (e.g., for loops, if-else statements,etc.) to the more convenient methods that are assocoated with JavaScript (e.g., filter, reduce, ternary,etc.). ALthough it makes the code look and read much better, the short hand coding requires a change in thought process.
